# menudb_images

This repository is for storing image assets for MenuDB.

⚠️ Important: Git is not designed for large files nor binary files. Furthermore, if one "removes" files, they remain permanently in version history, so this repository quite simply grows irreversibly in size.

Therefore, before committing any image file, please downsize it as follows:

1. On macOS, control-click (or right click) on the input image file(s) and choose Quick Actions > Convert Image.
1. For "Format", choose JPEG. For "Image Size", use your best judgment, but as a guideline, stay under 500K.

To prevent accidentally committing very large files, there are `gitignore` rules to enforce this procedure.
